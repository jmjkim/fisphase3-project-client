# EMNF-S Manager 

Engine Manufacturing Status Manager is a full-stack web application for my phase 3 software engineering course at Flatiron School. Front-end was built with **React** and **Active Record, Sinatra, SQLite3** for Back-end.

This application is ideal for Vehicle Engine Factory Staffs who needs to view and manage engines that are being manufactured.
